            My name is Shakeel Jivraj, and I am entering my second year of the Statistics Co-op program at the University of Toronto. I will be specializing in Data Science and Machine Learning.
            <br> <br> Through this project, I have combined my passion of Computer Science and Mathematics with my interest in the NHL and prospect development. As I continue with my undergraduate studies, I hope to expand my knowledge of Data Science and AI and continue to use my skills to solve real world problems. Thank you for checking out my website and I hope you enjoyed it.
