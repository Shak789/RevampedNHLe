            A New Approach to NHL Equivalency:  <br>
            Redefining Conversion Factors and Prospect Projections
    
        <p id="Content">
            Discover a new NHLe (NHL equivalency) model that measures the value of one point in other leagues relative to the NHL. It considers the various pathways that prospects undertake on their journey to the NHL and provides accurate point projection for players.

            An Enhanced Networking Approach

        <p id="Paragraph">
            Traditional NHLe models compute conversion factors based on the assumption <br> that players directly transition from their respective leagues to the NHL. However, prospects often play in multiple leagues before reaching the NHL.
            <br> <br> To solve this issue, newer NHLe models have employed the networking approach, which considers multiple pathways from different leagues to the NHL and combines conversion factors between leagues. Unfortunately, the networks include various transitions that players would not typically make, leading to inaccurate equivalency factors. For instance, they may account for transitions between multiple European and North American leagues, even though most prospects usually follow a fixed path through developmental leagues before reaching the NHL.
            <br> <br> The Revamped NHLe model analyzes the paths that prospects are most likely to take on their journey to the NHL. It thus reflects the actual development of prospects and provides more accurate equivalency factors.

            A New Lens into Prospect Projections
        </p>

        <p id="Paragraph">
        In contrast to newer models that assign probabilities to a player's potential based on their NHLe, this approach recognizes the limitations of a purely statistical approach. Although there is a strong correlation between NHLe and a NHL playerâ€™s success, player development is influenced by factors beyond point production, such as defensive skills, linemates and special team contributions.  
        <br> <br> The model provides a realistic projection for prospects by solely predicting their future point totals in the NHL. These predictions are derived from historical NHLe data of current players and adjusted to account for prospects of different ages. 
        <br> <br> To improve the accuracy of these projections, the NHLe model can be combined with traditional scouting reports, which offer valuable insights into player qualities that NHLe cannot capture. By combining statistical analysis and informed scouting, this model can provide more reliable evaluations of prospects.
